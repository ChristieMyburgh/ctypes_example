# ctypes_example
Code associated with an tutorials discussing ctypes and python bindings in general.

The first two tutorials have been published [here](https://dbader.org/blog/python-ctypes-tutorial) and [here](https://dbader.org/blog/python-ctypes-tutorial-part-2)

I'm hoping to write a third tutorial.  Current front-runners for topic ideas are cffi and swig.

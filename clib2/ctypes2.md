The built-in [`ctypes` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) is a powerful feature in Python, allowing you to use existing libraries in other languages by writting simple wrappers in Python itself.

In the first part of this tutorial, we covered the basics of ctypes.  In part two we will dig a little deeper covering:

* creating simple Python classes to mirror C structures
* passing by value versus passing by reference (pointers)
* nested structures
* expanding our C structure wrappers to hide the complexity from Python code
